# Polymath24 Nonlocal Differential Equations Project

Welcome fellow researchers (and curious readers)!  

This repository contains Python code that runs a **fixed-point iteration** to solve the **Volterra integral equation of the second kind** arising from the continuation argument in our paper *"Nonlocal Initial Value Problems with Finite Interaction Horizon"* (soon to be published).  

Originally, this code was shared via Google Colab, but it has now been moved to GitHub for broader access and reproducibility.

## Abstract (excerpt)

In this paper, we introduce and study a class of initial value problems where the time derivative is represented through a nonlocal operator with finite horizon of interaction. The initial data is set on an interval to ensure well-posedness. We prove existence of solutions under a set of conditions on the nonlinearity, present sensitivity results, and showcase numerical simulations comparing the nonlocal solution to its classical counterpart.

## Introduction (excerpt)

Nonlocal frameworks have been adopted over the last couple of decades in a variety of applications to model behavior that is:  

- singular (e.g., fracture and damage),  
- anomalous (such as diffusion), or  
- inherently nonlocal, i.e., dependent on dynamics from a region around a point, often represented through integral operators.  

The rapidly expanding body of work contains both theoretical and numerical studies in areas such as elasticity and dynamic fracture (Silling 2000; Silling 2007; Parks 2008), and phase separation (Burkovska 2021; Du et al. 2012; Gal 2023).
