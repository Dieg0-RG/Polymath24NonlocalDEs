# Polymath24 Nonlocal Differential Equations Project

To all my fellow researchers (and people passing by), 

This program runs the fixed point iteration to solve the Volterra integral equation of the second kind that arises from the continuation argument in our paper "NONLOCAL INITIAL VALUE PROBLEMS WITH FINITE
INTERACTION HORIZON" (soon to be published). Normally, this was code was shared in Google Colab, but has been moved to GitHub for the public eye.
